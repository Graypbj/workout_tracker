# Workz Tracker

## Description
This is a web app that I built to showcase my fullstack capabilities. The app allows users to login, track workouts by creating exercises, both cardio and strength, and see their workout history.

## Goal
The goal of this project was to create a simple site that is able to track a workout accurately and quickly. 

## Quick Start
To run this program yourself all you need to do is copy the repo 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Graypbj/workout_tracker.git
```
Make sure you have Golang and npm installed, and in the main folder run
```bash
go build -o out && ./out
```
Then in the frontend folder run
```bash
live-server --port=5500
```

This will then expose the backend on port 8080 and the front end on 5500.
